Carrom Using cocos2d



Overview:

Carrom is a Pool like game. Iâ€™ve created code base for those who wants to learn iPhone game programming. 

It also contains interactive Physics using chipmunk. I've done little modification to satisfy some physics requirements for board game's top-down view. 

!! Please don't compile this code and submit to appstore !! 
Use this codebase for your reference.

 Enjoy !!!
