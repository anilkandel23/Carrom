############### COCOS 2D WITH CHIPMUNK COPY/PASTE CODE ###################
############### Create a new project with Cocos2D With Chipmunk template ###################
PLEASE INCLUDE IN YOUR PROJECT Resources THE IMAGE FOR THIS SCENE: pointer.png


######## PUT THIS CODE IN THE INITIALIZATION FUNCTION AFTER YOU HAVE CREATED THE BOX2D WORLD 
 OR CREATE YOUR OWN FUNCTION AND PUT THIS CODE IN IT######
##This part creates the sprites and the polygon shapes #


FEATURE NOT AVAILABLE IN FREE VERSION
The free version does not show true vertices in the sprite.
The information you see here is just an example and does not reflect the real data.
